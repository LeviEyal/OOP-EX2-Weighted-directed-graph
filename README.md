## Subject: Unweighted - undirected graph


## The operations:


## How to use?
clone the project to your computer and run the file Ex2.jar by the command `java -jar Ex2` on the same folder as Ex2.jar is on.
the main window of the game will sow up:

Enter your ID and select the level you will to play and click the "play!" button.

Another way to login to the game is by the command `java -jar Ex2.jar 123456789 7` where 123456789 is your id and 7 is the level you want to play. 
## Project structure
